## Abstract

In this portion of the project, I was able to look at my dataset, clean, and make some graphs out of them. The hardest part of this was to clean the dataset. I wasn't able to clean it perfectly to make it 'tidy', but I was able to clean enough to get initial graphs out. In the future, I'd love to discover how grep and regex works since I will be needing it to make my dataset cleaner. Overall, it was a great experiance and was able to see the power of R. 

### 1. Discovery and Data Preparation

I was able to discover that this linkedin dataset was not perfect and needed a lot of cleaning.
